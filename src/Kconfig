config SPEAKUP
	bool "Speakup console speech"
	---help---
		This enables configuring speakup, the Linux kernel based
		screen review system. speakup supports a variety of
		hardware speech synthesizers and can also drive
		userspace speech software synthesizers.

		For more info, see http://www.linux-speakup.org

		This option alone doesn't affect your kernel; it just
		enables the options below so you can configure speakup.

		If you are not sure you need this, say n.

config SPEAKUP_CORE
	depends on VT
	depends on SPEAKUP
	tristate "Speakup engine"
	---help---
		This is the Speakup screen reader.  Think of it as a
		video console for blind people.  If built in to the
		kernel, it can speak everything on the text console from
		boot up to shutdown.  For more information on Speakup,
		point your browser at http://www.linux-speakup.org/.
		There is also a mailing list at the above url that you
		can subscribe to.
		
		Supported synthesizers are accent sa, accent pc,
		appollo II., Auddapter, Braille 'n Speak, Dectalk
		external (old), Dectalk PC (full length isa board),
		Dectalk express, Doubletalk, Doubletalk LT or
		Litetalk, Keynote Gold internal PC, software
		synthesizers, Speakout, and transport.
		
		Speakup can either be built in or compiled as a module
		by answering y or m.  If you answer y here, then you
		must answer either y or m to at least one of the
		synthesizer drivers below.  If you answer m here, then
		the synthesizer drivers below can only be built as
		modules.
		
		These drivers are not standalone drivers, but must be
		used in conjunction with Speakup.  Think of them as
		video cards for blind people.
		
		
		The Dectalk pc driver can only be built as a module, and
		requires software to be pre-loaded on to the card before
		the module can be loaded.  See the decpc choice below
		for more details.
		
		If you are not a blind person, or don't have access to
		one of the listed synthesizers, you should say n.

		synthesizer.  You can say y to build it into the kernel,
		or m to build it as a module.  See the configuration
		help on the Speakup choice above for more info.

config SPEAKUP_SYNTH_DECTLK
	depends on SPEAKUP_CORE
	tristate "DECtalk Express synthesizer support"
	---help---

		synthesizer.  You can say y to build it into the kernel,
		or m to build it as a module.  See the configuration
		help on the Speakup choice above for more info.

config SPEAKUP_SYNTH_DECEXT
	depends on SPEAKUP_CORE
	tristate "DECtalk External (old) synthesizer support"
	---help---
		
		This is the Speakup driver for the DecTalk External
		(old) synthesizer.  You can say y to build it into the

config SPEAKUP_SYNTH_DECPC
	depends on SPEAKUP_CORE
	tristate "DECtalk PC (big ISA card) synthesizer support"
	---help---
		
		This is the Speakup driver for the DecTalk PC (full
		length ISA) synthesizer.  You can say m to build it as
		a module.  See the configuration help on the Speakup
		choice above for more info.
		
		In order to use the DecTalk PC driver, you must download
		the dec_pc.tgz file from linux-speakup.org.  It is in
		the pub/linux/goodies directory.  The dec_pc.tgz file
		contains the software which must be pre-loaded on to the
		DecTalk PC board in order to use it with this driver.
		This driver must be built as a module, and can not be
		loaded until the file system is mounted and the DecTalk
		PC software has been pre-loaded on to the board.
		
		See the README file in the dec_pc.tgz file for more
		details.
