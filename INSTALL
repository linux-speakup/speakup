speakup installation instructions
=================================

Installing speakup requires knowledge of building your own kernel. Hopefully
your distro includes speakup in your kernel, so that you don't have to install
it yourself. But if they don't, here are some basic instructions:

speakup is divided into spkglue and speakup. spkglue must be patched into your
kernel but speakup can optionally be built externally.



1. SPKGLUE INTERNAL, SPEAKUP EXTERNAL
=====================================

This method involves making a small modification to your kernel source, and
then building the bulk of the speakup code as modules outside of the kernel
source tree.

Unpack your kernel sources to a known directory, e.g. /usr/src/linux
From the directory where you have unpacked speakup, run:

	# ./install-spkglue /usr/src/linux

You should be presented with a single message informing you that spkglue has
been installed.

Next, configure, compile and install your kernel.

When that is done, you can compile and install the speakup modules. From the
directory where you have unpacked speakup, run:

	# cd src
	# make KERNELDIR=/usr/src/linux

Then, as root, from the same directory, run:

	# make KERNELDIR=/usr/src/linux modules_install

You are now in a position to configure the speakup modules to be loaded during
boot, and to boot into your new kernel.


2. SPKGLUE INTERNAL, SPEAKUP INTERNAL
=====================================

This method involves patching both spkglue and speakup directly into your
kernel source. You can then build speakup by selecting it in the kernel
configuration just like any other driver.

Unpack your kernel sources to a known directory, e.g. /usr/src/linux
From the directory where you have unpacked speakup, run:

	# ./install /usr/src/linux

You should be presented with a few messages informing you that spkglue and
speakup have been installed, and that the operation completed successfully.

Next, configure, compile and install your kernel. Remember to select speakup
and the appropriate synth modules when in the configuration menu!

You can now boot into your new kernel.
