speakup installation instructions
=================================

Installing speakup requires knowledge of building your own kernel. Hopefully
your distro includes speakup in your kernel, so that you don't have to install
it yourself. But if they don't, here are some basic instructions:

Speakup consists of 2 patches for the kernel (one for the source and another
for the build system) as well as the code for the speakup modules.  There are 3
ways to install speakup into your system.



1.  NORMAL INSTALLATION
========================

This method will patch speakup into both your kernel source and build system so
that you can select and configure speakup during your normal kernel
configuration process.  It will also create symbolic links in your kernel tree
that point to the speakup source in the location where you unpacked speakup.
This way, the speakup source is not actually moved into the kernel tree, and
allows easy updating if you are using the speakup git repository for example.

Unpack your kernel source to a known location such as /usr/src/linux
from the location where speakup is unpacked run:

# ./install /usr/src/linux

At this point, you will be presented with messages about the patches being
applied to your kernel, followed by a message stating whether or not the
installation was successful.

If the installation was successful, configure, compile and install your kernel
the usual way.  Remember to select speakup and the appropriate synthesizer
support from the configuration menu.

As of this writing, building speakup into the kernel only works if one
synthesizer is selected.  If you build speakup into your kernel, do not select
more than one synthesizer.

You can now boot into your new kernel.


2.  FULL INSTALLATION
=====================

A full installation is almost identical to a normal installation.  The
difference is that the speakup source files are copied directly into the kernel
source tree.  This allows you to remove the speakup distribution from your
system.

Unpack your kernel source to a known location such as /usr/src/linux
From the location where speakup is unpacked run:

# ./install /usr/src/linux full

The remaining steps are identical to a normal installation.


3.  MODULAR INSTALLATION
========================

This installation method only patches the kernel source and allows building the
majority of the speakup code as modules outside the kernel build system.

Unpack your kernel source to a known location such as /usr/src/linux
From the directory where you have unpacked speakup, run:

# ./install /usr/src/linux modular

At this point, you will be presented with messages about the patches being
applied to your kernel, followed by a message stating whether or not the
installation was successful.

If the installation was successful, configure, compile and install your kernel.

When that is done, you can compile and install the speakup modules. From the
directory where you have unpacked speakup, run:

# cd src
# make KERNELDIR=/usr/src/linux

Then, as root, from the same directory, run:

# make KERNELDIR=/usr/src/linux modules_install

You are now in a position to configure the speakup modules to be loaded during
boot, and to boot into your new kernel.
