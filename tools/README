Speakup Tools

This directory contains extra tools which make speakup easier to use.
Below you will find a brief description of these tools and how to
use them.

speakupconf

This script was originally written by Steve Holmes
<steve@holmesgrown.com>, and it is now being maintained as part of the
speakup project.  Its function is to save and load speakup's
configurable settings.  If it is run as root, it will save settings in
/etc/speakup, or if it is run as a user, in $HOME/.speakup.

talkwith

This script was originally written by Chuck Hallenbeck <chuckh@ftml.net>.
Its function is to make switching between supported synthesizers very
simple.
