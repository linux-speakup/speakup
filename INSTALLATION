speakup installation instructions
=================================

Installing speakup requires knowledge of building your own kernel. Hopefully
your distro includes speakup in your kernel, so that you don't have to install
it yourself. But if they don't, here are some basic instructions:

Speakup consists of a patch for the kernel as well as the source for the speakup
modules. To install speakup, follow the following steps:

Unpack your kernel source to a known location such as /usr/src/linux
from the location where speakup is unpacked run:

# ./install /usr/src/linux

At this point, you will be presented with messages about patches being
applied to your kernel, followed by a message stating whether or not the
installation was successful.

If the installation was successful, configure, compile and install your kernel
the usual way.  Remember to select speakup and the appropriate synthesizer
support from the configuration menu.

As of this writing, building speakup into the kernel only works if one
synthesizer is selected.  If you build speakup into your kernel, do not select
more than one synthesizer.

If, on the other hand, you build speakup as modules, you can build as many
synthesizer driver modules as you like.

You can now boot into your new kernel.
