This file is a work list and specifications for the tasks which need
to be completed to get the git version of speakup ready for
prime-time.  Hopefully folks will undertake some of the tasks here and
help by submitting patches to implement them.  If you can think of
better ways of implementing any of these please speakup!


A method needs to be developed to once again provide a way for speakup
to speak the kernel messages from boot up.  This might be done
possibly by reading the printk() circular buffer and sending it to the
synth.  It might also be done by once again capturing the early kernel
output and storing it in the speakup synth buffer until a synth is
registered.


Here are a couple projects which might be something someone can take
on if they are interested in improving speakup.

Enhance speakup's window handling mechanism to allow more controlable
windows for silencing or monitoring and activating other speakup
features.

Monitor the current task to load program specific configurations.

Enhance speakup's cut-and paste feature to place and read material
from the gnome cut-and-paste buffer.  This was a request from Janina
on the speakup list with suggestions how it might be done.
