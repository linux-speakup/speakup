This file is a work list and specifications for the tasks which need
to be completed to get the git version of speakup ready for
prime-time.  Hopefully folks will undertake some of the tasks here and
help by submitting patches to implement them.  If you can think of
better ways of implementing any of these please speakup!


Kernel command line and modules specification. on the kcl with speakup
built-in speakup will be the keyword with arguments separated by a
period as in speakup.synth=ltlk for the LiteTalk synthesizer.  Each
argument will require a separate occurrence of the speakup command so
that a person wanting to specify the LiteTalk on ttyS2 would type at
the kcl: linux speakup.synth=ltlk speakup.ser=2.  In the case of
loading speakup from modules modprobe would be followed by
speakup_ltlk for the LiteTalk and additional arguments are passed as
separate arguments such as: modprobe speakup_ltlk ser=2 quiet=1 to
load the LiteTalk driver specifying ttyS2 and starting quietly. The
current available arguments are synth, ser, port and quiet.


Need a script to check the modified kernel sources and take diff's
against them like the old checkin script did.  This will make getting
edits to the kernel source a lot easier to get into the repository.
Quilt might be useful for something like this.  When using the linux
git repository git-diff can be used.


The install-spkglue script will need to be made smarter so that the
correct speakup version can be checked out for the correct linux
version.  It also needs some way to actually create a reject file when
it fails so it's easier to hunt down the patching trouble.


Various methods have been discussed on how to best rewrite portions of
speakup to implement the tty discipline for serial synths.  Currently
we have kludged the io port method we've always used by supplying the
parametres which have been removed from kernels starting at 2.6.22.
This however is only a temporary fix except for synths which use
non-standard rs232c ports.  Samuel has suggested using filp_open() for
module built speakup and possibly a virtual file system for the
built-in case.


Need to re examen synth probing to attempt to identify the synth by
the probing sequence it responds to.  It is at least important to
identify that you have the synth you have requested to prevent getting
the wrong serial port.


Need to start moving speakups /proc file system functions over to
/sys.  Also need to re implement synth_name support to provide the
ability to switch synths when speakup is built-in.
