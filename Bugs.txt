This file is to keep track of the bugs we know about until we come up
with a better bug tracking system.  Feel free to try your hand at
fixing any of these!

The DECTalk Express driver is not finding the synth with the git
repository in driver speakup_dectlk.c. Fixed as of Feb 25 2008.

Starting with 2.6.22 speakup's cut and paste system appears to be
pumping random garbage into the paste position.  This is extremely
dangerous and will very easily hang the computer.

When switching between consoles with the alt-function keys or
alt-left/right arrows speakup is not getting updated to the new
screens cursor position.  I am not sure how long this has been an
issue but I know it is a problem in my 2.6.19.1 system so it's been
around for a while.  This should be fixed in 2.6.25 (since -rc4).

Speakup's Key Echo does not always raise the pitch when upper case characters
are typed.
