with a better bug tracking system.  Feel free to try your hand at
fixing any of these!

The DECTalk Express driver is not finding the synth with the git
repository in driver speakup_dectlk.c.

Starting with 2.6.22 speakup's cut and paste system appears to be
pumping random garbage into the paste position.  This is extremely
dangerous and will very easily hang the computer.
