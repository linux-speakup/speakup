speakup 
=======

speakup is a kernel-based speech synthesizer driver suite for Linux. It drives
various serial-based and ISA-based synthesizer hardware, as well as providing
an interface for driving software-based synthesizers in userspace.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.
For usage documentation, see the files in the doc/ subdirectory.

This release is intended to apply against Linux 2.6.19. Other kernels are
probably not supported by this release.

Support is provided through a mailing list on the above site.

Usage
=====

There are different ways that speakup can be configured, but the most common
is building speakup and the synth drivers as modules. At this point it is just
a case of using modprobe to load a synth module driver, which will pull in
the speakup core as a dependency, e.g.:

	modprobe spk_synth_soft

Further user documentation can be found in the doc/ subdirectory, specifically
doc/spkguide.txt. Some information here may be out of date, corrections are
accepted. Also see the UPGRADING file.

Implementation
==============

As mentioned above, speakup is implemented as a series of kernel drivers.
Usually this kind of thing would be kept purely in userspace, however by
implementing it this way, blind people would be excluded from kernel
development and other low-level activities due to not being able to 'see'
the early boot messages, kernel crash dumps, etc.

The long term plan is for kernel inclusion, but the kernel developers may
decide that this kind of functionality should be kept out of the kernel for
purely technical reasons.

speakup requires hooks into the keyboard and vt (console) drivers already
present in the Linux kernel. In order to provide modularization, a small glue
layer is provided: spkglue.

spkglue is the component which hooks into vt.c and keyboard.c. spkglue must
either be built into the kernel or not built at all, it cannot be built as
a module. Having spkglue built into your kernel is a prerequisite for using
speakup.

spkglue must therefore be installed to your kernel sources - kernel patching
is required. A script is provided to automate this for you.

spkglue provides a simple interface for a 'client' to register. In this case,
speakup is the client. spkglue's hooks do nothing until a client has registered,
and at that point, all invocations of the hooks are passed up to the client 
(speakup).

Examples of the events which speakup is interested in include key presses and
characters being printed to the console. These events are passed from core
kernel to spkglue through to speakup.

speakup is then built as a standard kernel module, and does the necessary
event processing and also includes some library code. speakup doesn't actually
drive any hardware though - that is left up to a set of additional kernel
modules: the synth drivers. synth drivers drive specialised synthesizer
hardware, except from the soft driver which provides a simple text interface
to a software-based synthesizer which runs in userspace.

The hierachy looks something like:

	vt+keyboard <---> spkglue <---> speakup <---> synth drivers

speakup and the synth drivers can actually be built outside the kernel,
provided that you have read access to spkglue-patched kernel sources of your
currently running kernel, and your running kernel has spkglue compiled in.

Alternatively, speakup can be patched into your kernel alongside spkglue.
This gives you the option of compiling speakup and synth modules directly
into your kernel, which gives you the added functionality of being able to
hear early boot messages.
