			speakup contributions

This directory is for useful contributions by speakup users and
developers which help make speakup easier and more fun to use.

espeakup - A connector that allows speakup to use the espeak software
speech synthesizer.  This was written by William Hubbs
<w.d.hubbs@gmail.com>.  It has its own git repository at
git://hubbs.homedns.org/espeakup.git.

speakupconf - A shell script written by Steve Holmes
<steve@holmesgrown.com> for saving and restoring speakup's customizable
variables.

synthscripts - These scripts were written by Chuck Hallenbeck
<chuckh@ftml.net> to make switching between synthesizers very simple.
The difference between them is that speakwith uses speech dispatcher
for software speech, and  talkwith uses espeakup.
