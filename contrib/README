			speakup contributions

This directory is for useful contributions by speakup users and
developers which help make speakup easier and more fun to use.

espeakup - A connector that allows speakup to use the espeak software
speech synthesizer.  This was donated by William Hubbs

git://hubbs.homedns.org/espeakup.git.

speakupconf - A shell script donated by Bill Acker
<wacker@octothorp.org> for saving and restoring speakup's customizable
variables.

speakwith - a shell script written by Chuck Hallenbeck
<chuckh@ftml.net> which makes flipping between synths very simple.
